# SAMPLER: Unsupervised representations for rapid analysis of whole slide tissue images
Here we provide the code associated with the SAMPLER manuscript"SAMPLER: Unsupervised representations for rapid analysis of whole slide tissue images" [1]. We provide exmaples how to use it and share SAMPLER represeantions of frozen and FFPE breast cancer (BRCA), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) whole slide images (WSIs) of TCGA, as well as BRCA and NSCLC WSIs of CPTAC.

# Using SAMPLER
The easiest way to use SAMPLER is to copy the "SAMPLER.py" file into the main folder of the python code and load it with "import". SAMPLER only uses basic functions in os, numpy, scipy, and pickle packages, and is not sensitive to the exact version of the installed package. Alternatively, clone this repository and run setup.py in the SAMPLER folder. Most of SAMPLER's helper functions are for creating attention maps. If only SAMPLER representations are needed, they can be created using a single line of code:

wsi_sampler=np.ravel(np.percentile(X,pers,axis=0)).

X is the WSI feature matrix where rows are tiles and columns are features. pers are the percentiles that comprise SAMPLER represenations. We used ten deciles, i.e., pers=[5,15,25,...,95], but higher/lower resolutions can be considered. If you have the SAMPLER package installed (or copied) SAMPLER.SAMPLERrep(X) computes the SAMPLER representation.


We have provided a Jupyter notebook example for computing SAMPLER represeantions from tile features, building SAMPLER-based predictive models, and generating SAMPLER attention maps at https://zenodo.org/records/10346576.
